It's a rare day that passes without me getting some small bit of Python code from ChatGPT to solve the problem of the moment. I can write Python, but ChatGPT is roughly 1,000x faster than me for small tasks. Many of these are single use, others end up in ~/bin and I usually forget I have them, leading to repeat ChatGPT time/cost. I'm going to just pile up this random stuff in a public repository in the hope I get a little more disciplined about this stuff.

And if it benefits you in some way, that's a nice bonus ...
